<h3>A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing — no 
particles or even electromagnetic radiation such as light — can escape from it.The 
theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform 
spacetime to form a black hole.The boundary of no escape is called the event 
horizon. Although it has an enormous effect on the fate and circumstances of an object 
crossing it, according to general relativity it has no locally detectable features.In 
many ways, a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light.Moreover,
quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts that event horizons emit Hawking 
radiation, with the same spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely 
proportional to its mass. This temperature is on the order of billionths of a kelvin 
for black holes of stellar mass, making it essentially impossible to observe directly.

<h3>Objects whose gravitational fields are too strong for light to escape were first 
considered in the 18th century by John Michell and Pierre-Simon Laplace.The first 
modern solution of general relativity that would characterize a black hole was found by 
Karl Schwarzschild in 1916, and its interpretation as a region of space from which 
nothing can escape was first published by David Finkelstein in 1958. Black holes were 
long considered a mathematical curiosity; it was not until the 1960s that theoretical 
work showed they were a generic prediction of general relativity. The discovery of 
neutron stars by Jocelyn Bell Burnell in 1967 sparked interest in gravitationally 
collapsed compact objects as a possible astrophysical reality. The first black hole 
known as such was Cygnus X-1, identified by several researchers independently in 1971

<b>Black holes of stellar mass form when very massive stars collapse at the end 
of their life cycle. After a black hole has formed, it can continue to grow by absorbing
mass from its surroundings. By absorbing other stars and merging with other black holes,
supermassive black holes of millions of solar masses may form. There is consensus that
supermassive black holes exist in the centers of most galaxies.</b>

<b>The presence of a black hole can be inferred through its interaction with other 
matter and with electromagnetic radiation such as visible light. Matter that falls 
onto a black hole can form an external accretion disk heated by friction, forming 
quasars, some of the brightest objects in the universe. Stars passing too close to a 
supermassive black hole can be shred into streamers that shine very brightly before 
being "swallowed."If there are other stars orbiting a black hole, their orbits 
can be used to determine the black hole's mass and location. Such observations can be 
used to exclude possible alternatives such as neutron stars. In this way, astronomers 
have identified numerous stellar black hole candidates in binary systems, and 
established that the radio source known as Sagittarius, at the core of the Milky Way 
galaxy, contains a supermassive black hole of about 4.3 million solar masses.</b>
